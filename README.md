# sortbenchcpp
Sample C++ project for benchmarking various sorting algorithms

Please note that the sorting subroutines used in the code are covered by various licenses, from Public Domain through MIT and Creative Commons to CC-BY-SA for stackoverflow sourced code. Please also keep in mind that no matter the license indicated here, some snippets are just common lore -- like the functional Quicksort sample in Haskell.

No benchmarking harness was used -- although some nifty timing C++-11 code is included
